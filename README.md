# docker-alpine-python

Docker containers running Alpine linux with Python and s6 for process management. Small and reliable containers to run Python applications (e.g. Flask web apps).

The containers are based on the _alpine-base_ containers from [smebberson/docker-alpine](https://github.com/smebberson/docker-alpine/tree/master/alpine-base).
The _alpine-base_ containers provides highly configurable Docker images running [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) and [s6](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/) process management.
